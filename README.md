Assignments/labs/projects for cs61a fall 2016 done by me. 

Note to self: Understand the constant space problem in lab07.


PRO LIFE TIP: If anyone is reading this and you've reached the scheme project, make sure that you define __getitem__ methods for the Pair and nil classes.This allows you to use for loops and functions like zip() with your pair object.This makes a lot of problems in the project extremely easy. 

Note: While the above method makes our code look cleaner, it is inefficient. 
 
Have fun!
